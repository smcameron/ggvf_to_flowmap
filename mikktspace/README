Do not modify the mikktspace.c or mikktspace.h in this directory.

This is unmodified code by Morton Mikkelsen for computing tangent and
bitangent vectors for purposes of normal mapping.
    
I have taken this code from from the godot engine project.
https://github.com/godotengine/godot from thirdparty/misc/mikktspace.[ch]
